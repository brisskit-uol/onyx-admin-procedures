DEVELOPMENT CONSIDERATIONS: Inspect the POM.
===========================================
There is a production profile and a development profile.
The build is production by default.
Look at the enironment.type property setting within the pom, 
which is used to produce two artifacts (development and production versions).
Please note that at December 2012 there were no differences between a
development and a production version. However, it is conceivable that in future
the development version could be configured to do things not desirable within
a production environment; eg: drop databases.

To install or deploy, please use the mvn-*.sh scripts:

(a) mvn-install-dev.sh
(b) mvn-install-prod.sh
(c) mvn-deploy-dev.sh
(d) mvn-deploy-prod.sh

(a) and (b) install to your local maven repository
(c) and (d) deploy to the Brisskit maven repository.

You need authorisation for (c) and (d); ie: an OS account on the machine
hosting the Brisskit maven repo plus (for convenience) a public/private
key setup.
