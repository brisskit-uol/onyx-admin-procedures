PREREQUISITES.
==============
If you have Onyx installed, then the prerequisites are almost certainly present.
Other run-time dependencies are held within the lib directory.

QUICK START.
============
1. Unzip this package into the Onyx install directory.
2. Edit the set.sh file within the brisskit bin/global directory of the admin package.
   'Source' the set.sh file at the start of any shell session.
   (There should be no need to do this as sudo or root)
   Use "source ./set.sh" or ". ./set.sh" at the command line or within a composition script.
   Remember, if you execute any script as sudo, then you must inherit the environment variables; eg:
   > sudo -E ./3-onyx2metadata.sh job-20130214
3. You must also edit the script bin/cron-export-process/process-export.sh which runs as root
   via a cron job and therefore needs a different approach than the above for environment variables.
   The first line should read something like:
   source /var/local/brisskit/onyx/set.sh
   Edit this if your install directory is different from /var/local/brisskit/onyx
3  Review configuration settings within the config directory.
   Basically these files:
   config.properties
   defaults.sh
   log4j.properties
   export-metadata-config-nominal.xml
   export-metadata-config-real.xml
   
   The relevance of the latter two depend upon whether you wish to
   generate a nominal ontology (from an export file) or a research-based ontology.
   
5. The rough order of completion (by directories) of procedures:
   i)  i2b2-data-prep (ontology aspects) : once, and then occasionally when required)
   ii) i2b2-meta-upload : once, and then occasionally when required
   ii) i2b2-data-prep (pdo aspects) : regular
   iv) i2b2-participant-upload : regular
   
   civicrm loading of participant data into Onyx should be regular. 
   It is not constrained by any of the above procedures.
