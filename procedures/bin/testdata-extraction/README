The test data extraction scripts should ONLY EVER be executed in their own job environment.

For example, consider this invocation:

extract-testdata-for-ws.sh TEST-JOB onyxexport.zip -bid=demo-0001

Where TEST-JOB is the job name. Do NOT share this job name with any executions that
derive live PDO data for upload. This is because the test data extraction process
scrambles data in the unzipped export file!!!!
